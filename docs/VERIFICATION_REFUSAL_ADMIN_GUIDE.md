# User Verification Status: "Refused" - Admin Guide

## Why Users Get "Refused" Status

When a user shows **"Refused"** status, it means an administrator has **manually reviewed and rejected** their verification request.

## üîç How to Check Why a User Was Refused

### Check the Admin Verification Panel
1. **Go to Admin Panel** ‚Üí **"Verificaci√≥n de Documentos" tab**
2. **Find the user** in the requests table
3. **Look for admin notes** in the rejected entry - this shows the specific refusal reason

## ‚ùå Common Reasons for Refusal

### **Document Quality Issues:**
- Blurry, pixelated, or unreadable documents
- Partial documents (cut off edges)
- Poor lighting or shadows obscuring text
- Screenshots instead of original scans

### **Information Mismatch:**
- Name on ID doesn't match profile name
- Email address inconsistencies
- Date of birth discrepancies
- Address information doesn't align

### **Document Problems:**
- Expired identification documents
- Invalid or fake-looking documents
- Wrong document types submitted
- Missing required documents

### **Suspicious Activity:**
- Multiple accounts using same documents
- Recently created account with immediate verification
- Unusual activity patterns
- Documents appear tampered or edited

### **Policy Violations:**
- User doesn't meet minimum age requirements
- Geographic restrictions (not in supported regions)
- Prohibited user categories
- Terms of service violations

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Help Refused Users

### **For Legitimate Refusals:**
1. **Contact the user** via email
2. **Explain the specific issue** (use admin notes as reference)
3. **Provide clear instructions** for resubmission:
   - "Please resubmit with clearer document photos"
   - "Ensure your ID matches the name on your profile"
   - "Submit a current, non-expired ID"

### **For Policy Issues:**
1. **Inform user of policy violation**
2. **Explain if issue is correctable or permanent**
3. **Provide appeals process if applicable**

## üìã Best Practices for Admin Review

### **When Reviewing Documents:**
- ‚úÖ Check document clarity and readability
- ‚úÖ Verify information matches user profile
- ‚úÖ Confirm documents are current/valid
- ‚úÖ Look for signs of tampering or fraud
- ‚úÖ **Always add detailed admin notes when rejecting**

### **Admin Notes Examples:**
```
Good Examples:
- "ID document is blurry and unreadable. Please submit clearer photo."
- "Name on ID (John Smith) doesn't match profile name (Jo√£o Silva)."
- "Driver's license expired in 2023. Please submit current ID."
- "Document appears to be edited/tampered. Original documents required."

Bad Examples:
- "Rejected"
- "No good"
- "Try again"
```

## üîÑ Resubmission Process

### **For Users to Resubmit:**
1. User fixes the identified issues
2. Resubmits documents through profile
3. New verification request created
4. Admin reviews again with fresh perspective

### **For Admins:**
- Each resubmission is a **new verification request**
- Previous rejections are visible in history
- Judge each submission independently
- Consider improvement efforts in decision

## üö® Red Flags to Watch For

### **Immediate Rejection Warranted:**
- Obviously fake or generated documents
- Same documents used by multiple users
- Clearly edited/photoshopped images
- Inappropriate or offensive content in submissions
- Documents from unsupported regions/countries

### **Requires Further Investigation:**
- Borderline document quality
- Minor information discrepancies
- Recently expired documents (< 30 days)
- Unusual but potentially legitimate cases

## üìû Escalation Process

### **When to Escalate:**
- Uncertain about document authenticity
- User disputes rejection with valid concerns
- Complex policy interpretation needed
- Potential fraud requires investigation

### **Who to Contact:**
- Senior Admin Team
- Legal/Compliance Department
- Platform Security Team

## üìä Tracking and Analytics

### **Monitor Refusal Patterns:**
- High refusal rates may indicate unclear requirements
- Common refusal reasons suggest need for better user guidance
- Track resubmission success rates
- Monitor user satisfaction with verification process

### **Regular Review:**
- Weekly review of refusal reasons
- Monthly analysis of verification trends
- Quarterly policy updates based on patterns
- Annual training updates for admin team
