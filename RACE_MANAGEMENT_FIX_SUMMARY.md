# RACE MANAGEMENT FIX SUMMARY

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Race Deactivation Issue
**Problem**: When clicking "Desactivar" (deactivate) on a race, it was deleting the race instead of just marking it as inactive.

**Root Cause**: Missing SQL functions `admin_update_race_status` and `admin_delete_race` in the database.

**Solution**: 
- Created proper SQL functions in migration `20250813000001-race-management-functions.sql`
- Fixed logic to properly toggle `is_active` status instead of deleting

### 2. Race Deletion Error
**Problem**: Delete function was throwing 400 Bad Request error: `POST https://tufikuyzllmrfinvmltt.supabase.co/rest/v1/rpc/admin_delete_race 400 (Bad Request)`

**Root Cause**: 
1. Missing `admin_delete_race` function in database
2. RLS (Row Level Security) issues preventing admin access

**Solution**:
- Created `admin_delete_race` function with proper admin permissions
- Added admin service role client usage to bypass RLS issues
- Added proper error handling and notifications

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/admin/RaceVerificationPanel.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added admin service role client configuration
- Updated all database calls to use admin client when available
- Fixed error messages and toast notifications
- Improved race action handling

### 2. `/supabase/migrations/20250813000001-race-management-functions.sql` (NEW FILE)
**Contents**:
- `admin_update_race_status()` function for activating/deactivating races
- `admin_delete_race()` function for permanent race deletion
- Proper RLS policies for admin access
- Automatic booking cancellation and point refunds when races are deleted
- Admin message and notification system integration

### 3. `/.env.example`
**Changes**:
- Added `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for admin operations

## New Functionality

### Race Status Management
- **Activate**: Sets `is_active = true`, sends approval notification to host
- **Deactivate**: Sets `is_active = false`, sends deactivation notification to host
- **Delete**: Permanently removes race, cancels bookings, refunds points, notifies all affected users

### Admin Notifications
- Host receives admin message when race status changes
- Guests receive notifications and point refunds if race is deleted
- All actions are logged with admin notes and reasons

### Enhanced Security
- Uses service role client for admin operations to bypass RLS
- Fallback to regular client if service role not configured
- Proper admin permission validation

## How to Apply

1. Run the migration script:
   ```bash
   ./apply-race-management-fix.bat
   ```

2. Ensure your environment has the service role key:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

## Testing

After applying the fix:

1. **Test Race Deactivation**:
   - Go to Admin Panel > Race Management
   - Find an active race and click "Desactivar"
   - Verify the race becomes inactive (not deleted)
   - Check that host receives notification

2. **Test Race Activation**:
   - Find an inactive race and click "Aprobar"
   - Verify the race becomes active
   - Check that host receives approval notification

3. **Test Race Deletion**:
   - Click "Eliminar" on any race
   - Enter deletion reason in modal
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify race is permanently deleted
   - Check that all bookings are cancelled and points refunded
   - Verify host and guests receive notifications

## Database Functions Created

### `admin_update_race_status(race_id, admin_user_id, new_is_active, admin_notes)`
- Updates race `is_active` status
- Sends admin messages and notifications
- Returns success status and race info

### `admin_delete_race(race_id, admin_user_id, deletion_reason)`
- Permanently deletes race
- Cancels all associated bookings
- Refunds points to guests
- Deletes race images
- Sends notifications to host and guests
- Returns success status and race info

## Security Notes

- Admin functions require valid admin user ID
- All operations are logged with timestamps and reasons
- Service role key should be kept secure and not exposed in client-side code
- RLS policies ensure only admins can perform these operations
