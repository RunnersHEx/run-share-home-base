## New User Registration Guarantee

### ✅ **CONFIRMED: All New User Registrations Automatically Get `is_active = true`**

The system uses **multiple layers** to guarantee every new user starts with an active account:

1. **Database Column Default**: `is_active boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL`
2. **Database Trigger**: `ensure_user_active_on_insert()` forces `is_active = true` on every INSERT
3. **Registration Safety**: `prevent_accidental_deactivation()` prevents deactivation during registration process
4. **Application Logic**: AuthContext sets fallback `is_active = true` for all user profiles

### How It Works:
```sql
-- Trigger fires BEFORE every INSERT into profiles table
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_ensure_user_active
  BEFORE INSERT ON profiles
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION ensure_user_active_on_insert();

-- Function guarantees is_active = true
CREATE FUNCTION ensure_user_active_on_insert()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $
BEGIN
  NEW.is_active := true;  -- FORCE to true regardless of input
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$;
```

**Result**: Even if someone manually tries to create a user with `is_active = false`, the trigger will override it to `true`.

# User Activation/Deactivation System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive user activation/deactivation system with admin messaging functionality to the running platform. The system allows administrators to activate/deactivate user accounts and provides restricted access for deactivated users.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Added `is_active` column to `profiles` table (defaults to `true`)
- **GUARANTEED ACTIVATION**: Database triggers ensure ALL new user registrations get `is_active = true`
- Created `admin_messages` table for admin-user communication
- Created database functions for user management:
  - `admin_toggle_user_status()` - Activate/deactivate users with messaging
  - `admin_delete_user_complete()` - Complete user deletion
  - `get_admin_messages_for_user()` - Retrieve admin messages
  - `mark_admin_message_read()` - Mark messages as read
- **Registration Safety Triggers**:
  - `ensure_user_active_on_insert()` - Forces all new profiles to have `is_active = true`
  - `prevent_accidental_deactivation()` - Prevents accidental deactivation during registration

### 2. Admin Panel Enhancements
**UserManagementPanel.tsx** now includes:
- Toggle buttons to activate/deactivate users
- Deactivation modal with reason input (required)
- User deletion functionality with confirmation
- Real-time status updates
- Comprehensive user statistics display

### 3. Admin Messaging System
**AdminMessages.tsx** component provides:
- Display of all admin messages for a user
- Message categorization (deactivation, activation, warning, general)
- Read/unread status tracking
- Detailed message modal view
- Automatic read marking when messages are opened

### 4. User Access Restrictions
**UserAccessGuard.tsx** component:
- Protects routes from deactivated users
- Allows access only to profile and messaging pages
- Shows informative restriction messages
- Provides guidance for deactivated users

### 5. Integration Points

#### Messaging Page (`MessagingPage.tsx`)
- Added "Mensajes del Administrador" tab
- Seamless integration with existing messaging interface
- Admin messages displayed alongside regular conversations

#### Profile Page (`Profile.tsx`)
- Added "Mensajes del Admin" section in sidebar navigation
- Full admin message history accessible from profile

#### Create Button Restrictions
- **PropertiesSection.tsx**: Create property buttons restricted for deactivated users
- **RacesSection.tsx**: Create race buttons restricted for deactivated users
- Edit/delete functionality remains available

### 6. Authentication Context Updates
**AuthContext.tsx** enhancements:
- Added `is_active` field to UserProfile interface
- Updated computed properties to consider account status
- Active status affects `canHost` and `canGuest` permissions

### 7. Notification System
**NotificationService.ts** additions:
- `ACCOUNT_ACTIVATED` and `ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED` notification types
- Automatic notifications sent when account status changes
- Rich notification data with admin information and reasons

## User Experience Flow

### For Administrators:
1. View all users in admin panel with status indicators
2. Click "Desactivar" to deactivate a user
3. Enter reason for deactivation (required)
4. System creates admin message and notification
5. User immediately restricted from most platform features
6. Can reactivate user later with single click

### For Deactivated Users:
1. Receives notification about deactivation
2. Can only access profile and messaging pages
3. Views admin message explaining deactivation reason
4. Can edit existing content but cannot create new items
5. Receives notification when reactivated
6. Full access restored upon reactivation

## Technical Architecture

### Database Functions
```sql
-- Toggle user status with messaging
admin_toggle_user_status(target_user_id, admin_user_id, deactivation_reason)

-- Complete user deletion
admin_delete_user_complete(target_user_id, admin_user_id, deletion_reason)

-- Retrieve user admin messages
get_admin_messages_for_user(target_user_id)

-- Mark message as read
mark_admin_message_read(message_id, target_user_id)
```

### Component Hierarchy

### Access Control Matrix

| Feature | Active User | Deactivated User | Notes |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| View Profile | ✅ | ✅ | Full access |
| Edit Profile | ✅ | ✅ | Can edit existing data |
| View Messaging | ✅ | ✅ | Including admin messages |
| Create Property | ✅ | ❌ | Restricted with message |
| Edit/Delete Property | ✅ | ✅ | Existing content editable |
| Create Race | ✅ | ❌ | Restricted with message |
| Edit/Delete Race | ✅ | ✅ | Existing content editable |
| Apply to Races | ✅ | ❌ | Booking restricted |
| Host/Guest Activities | ✅ | ❌ | Based on account status |
| Admin Messages | ✅ | ✅ | Critical for communication |

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on `admin_messages` table
2. **Admin function security** using `SECURITY DEFINER`
3. **Input validation** for all admin operations
4. **Audit trail** maintained for all admin actions
5. **Graceful degradation** for missing permissions

## Error Handling

- **Database errors** logged and user-friendly messages displayed
- **Permission errors** handled gracefully with fallbacks
- **Network errors** managed with retry mechanisms
- **State consistency** maintained across components

## Migration Instructions

1. Run the database migration: `20250812000004-add-user-activation-system.sql`
2. All existing users will be set to `is_active = true` by default
3. No breaking changes to existing functionality
4. New features are additive and backward compatible

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Admin deactivates user** → User receives notification and restriction
2. **Deactivated user tries to create** → Sees restriction message
3. **Admin reactivates user** → User gets notification and full access
4. **Admin deletes user** → Complete data removal with audit trail
5. **Admin messages** → Proper delivery and read status tracking

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly system for account management while maintaining data integrity and providing clear communication channels between administrators and users.
