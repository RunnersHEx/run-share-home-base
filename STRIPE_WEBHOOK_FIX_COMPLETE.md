# 🔧 STRIPE WEBHOOK FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## ❌ Problem Identified

Your webhook was receiving requests **without the `stripe-signature` header**, which means:
- Something is calling the webhook directly instead of Stripe
- Most likely a configuration issue in Stripe Dashboard

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Webhook Debugging
- **Added detailed logging** to identify the source of webhook calls
- **Enhanced error messages** with specific debugging information
- **Better environment variable validation**
- **Request source identification** (Stripe vs direct calls)

### 2. Configuration Verification
- **Clear error messages** explaining possible causes
- **Step-by-step troubleshooting guide**
- **Environment variable validation**

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Deploy the Fix:
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd D:/upwork/mygit_running

# Deploy updated webhook
supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

Or run the deployment script:
```bash
# On Windows
./deploy-webhook-fix.bat

# On Mac/Linux
./deploy-webhook-fix.sh
```

## 🔍 Required Configuration Check

### 1. Stripe Dashboard Configuration

Go to **[Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)**:

#### ✅ Webhook Endpoint URL:
```
https://tufikuyzllmrfinvmltt.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
```

#### ✅ Required Events:
- `checkout.session.completed` ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted` 
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`

#### ✅ Copy Signing Secret:
- Click on your webhook endpoint
- Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

### 2. Supabase Environment Variables

Go to **[Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tufikuyzllmrfinvmltt/settings/functions)**:

#### Set these variables:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (or sk_test_...)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (from Stripe Dashboard)
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Both keys must be from the same environment (test OR live)

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Test Webhook from Stripe Dashboard:
1. Go to **Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Your endpoint**
2. Click **"Send test webhook"**
3. Select `checkout.session.completed`
4. Check Supabase Function logs

### 2. Test Registration Flow:
1. Go to your app registration
2. Complete all steps including subscription
3. Verify payment on Stripe
4. Check if user account and subscription are created

## 🔧 Debugging Information

The updated webhook now provides **detailed debugging** in Supabase logs:

### ✅ What You'll See When Fixed:
```
[STRIPE-WEBHOOK] ✅ Event verified successfully
[STRIPE-WEBHOOK] 🎯 Processing checkout.session.completed
[STRIPE-WEBHOOK] 🆕 Creating new account with subscription
[STRIPE-WEBHOOK] ✅ User account created successfully
[STRIPE-WEBHOOK] ✅ Subscription created/updated successfully
```

### ❌ What You'll See If Still Broken:
```
[STRIPE-WEBHOOK] ERROR: Missing stripe-signature header
- Available headers: [list of headers]
- User agent: [request source]
- Possible causes: [detailed explanation]
```

## 🎯 Most Likely Fix

**The issue is probably in your Stripe Dashboard webhook configuration:**

1. **Wrong URL** - Must be exactly: `https://tufikuyzllmrfinvmltt.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
2. **Missing events** - Must include `checkout.session.completed`
3. **Wrong environment** - Test webhook secret with live keys or vice versa

## 📊 Verification Checklist

### ✅ Before Testing:
- [ ] Webhook deployed with new debugging
- [ ] Stripe webhook URL is correct
- [ ] All required events selected in Stripe
- [ ] Environment variables set in Supabase
- [ ] STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches Stripe dashboard

### ✅ After Testing:
- [ ] Test webhook from Stripe Dashboard succeeds
- [ ] Registration flow creates user account
- [ ] Subscription appears in database
- [ ] Payment appears in Stripe Dashboard

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

If you still get "Missing stripe-signature header":

1. **Check Supabase Function logs** - The new webhook provides detailed debugging
2. **Verify no duplicate webhooks** in Stripe Dashboard
3. **Ensure no development environments** are interfering
4. **Check if any custom code** is calling the webhook directly

## 🎉 Expected Result

After this fix:
1. **Registration flow will work completely**
2. **User accounts will be created after payment**
3. **Subscriptions will be stored in database**
4. **Webhook will process events from Stripe successfully**

The enhanced debugging will help you identify any remaining configuration issues quickly.
