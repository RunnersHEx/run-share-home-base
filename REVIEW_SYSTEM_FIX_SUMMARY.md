# Review System Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 409 Conflict Error - Duplicate Key Constraint Violation
**Problem**: Users couldn't submit reviews because of a unique constraint on `booking_id` that prevented multiple reviews for the same booking.

**Root Cause**: The database had a unique constraint on `booking_id` alone, but the system needs to allow both host and guest to review each other for the same booking.

**Solution**: 
- Created SQL migration to drop the problematic unique constraint
- Added new unique constraint on `(booking_id, reviewer_id)` combination
- This allows both host and guest to review the same booking, but prevents duplicate reviews from the same user

**Files Changed**:
- `fix-booking-reviews-constraint.sql` (new migration file)
- `apply-reviews-fix.bat` (script to help apply the fix)

### 2. 406 Not Acceptable Error - Query Issues
**Problem**: Getting 406 errors when fetching reviews from the profile page.

**Root Cause**: The query was using `*` selector and `single()` method incorrectly, causing API parsing issues.

**Solution**:
- Explicitly specified all required fields in select queries
- Changed from `single()` to `maybeSingle()` for optional queries
- Improved error handling

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/reviews/ReviewsSection.tsx`
- `src/services/reviewService.ts`

### 3. Spanish Text Updates
**Problem**: Need to change review category labels from "Precisión" to "Puntualidad" and "Valor" to "Facilidad"

**Solution**: Updated the category labels in the review form.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/reviews/ReviewForm.tsx`

### 4. Improved Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error messages weren't helpful for users.

**Solution**: 
- Added specific error handling for database constraint violations
- Better error messages for users
- More robust error handling throughout the review system

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/reviews/ReviewsSection.tsx`
- `src/services/reviewService.ts`

## How to Apply These Fixes

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-booking-reviews-constraint.sql`
4. Execute the SQL commands

**OR**

Run the batch file: `apply-reviews-fix.bat` for guided instructions.

### Step 2: Test the Fixes
1. Try submitting a review as a guest
2. Try submitting a review as a host for the same booking
3. Verify both reviews are saved successfully
4. Check that the Spanish text changes are visible
5. Test fetching reviews on the profile page

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Both hosts and guests can leave reviews for the same booking
- ✅ No more 409 conflict errors when submitting reviews
- ✅ No more 406 errors when fetching reviews
- ✅ Updated Spanish text: "Precisión" → "Puntualidad", "Valor" → "Facilidad"
- ✅ Better error messages for users
- ✅ More robust error handling throughout the system

## Database Schema Changes

The migration will:
1. Drop the unique constraint `booking_reviews_booking_id_key`
2. Add new unique constraint `booking_reviews_booking_reviewer_unique (booking_id, reviewer_id)`
3. Ensure proper foreign key constraints exist
4. Add performance indexes for better query performance

This ensures:
- Each user can only review a booking once (prevents spam)
- Both host and guest can review the same booking (allows mutual reviews)
- Better database performance for review queries

## Files Modified

1. **Database**:
   - `fix-booking-reviews-constraint.sql` (new)
   - `apply-reviews-fix.bat` (new)

2. **Frontend Components**:
   - `src/components/reviews/ReviewForm.tsx`
   - `src/components/reviews/ReviewsSection.tsx`

3. **Services**:
   - `src/services/reviewService.ts`

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve the robustness of the review system.
