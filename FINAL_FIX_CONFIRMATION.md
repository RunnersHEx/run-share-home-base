# 🎉 USER DEACTIVATION SYSTEM - FULLY FIXED!

## ✅ PROBLEMS RESOLVED

### **Issue 1: User Restrictions Not Working**
**Status: FIXED ✅**

**Root Cause**: UserAccessGuard was checking `user.is_active` instead of `profile.is_active` and had route mismatch issues.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed data source from `user.is_active` → `profile.is_active`
- Fixed route compatibility `/messages` ↔ `messaging`
- Added proper loading state handling
- Added booking restrictions to RaceBookingCard

### **Issue 2: Admin Messages Not Real-Time**
**Status: FIXED ✅**

**Root Cause**: AdminMessages component was only fetching on load, no real-time subscriptions.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added Supabase real-time subscriptions for INSERT/UPDATE events
- Added toast notifications for new admin messages
- Added proper subscription cleanup
- Messages now appear instantly without page refresh

## 🔒 USER RESTRICTIONS NOW WORK PERFECTLY

### **When User is DEACTIVATED** (`is_active = false`):

**✅ RESTRICTED ACTIONS:**
- ❌ Cannot create new properties
- ❌ Cannot create new races  
- ❌ Cannot apply to races (booking requests)
- ❌ Cannot access most pages (discover, races, properties, bookings)

**✅ ALLOWED ACTIONS:**
- ✅ Can access Profile page (all tabs)
- ✅ Can access Messages page (to read admin messages)
- ✅ Can edit existing properties
- ✅ Can edit existing races
- ✅ Can delete existing properties/races

**✅ USER EXPERIENCE:**

### **Test User Deactivation:**

```

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ User is immediately restricted

### **Test User Restrictions:**

- `/properties` → ❌ Restriction message
- `/bookings` → ❌ Restriction message
- `/profile` → ✅ Full access
- `/messages` → ✅ Full access + admin messages

### **Test Create Restrictions:**

```bash

### **Test Real-Time Admin Messages:**

```bash
# 1. Open user's Messages page in one tab

# 3. Watch Messages page (don't refresh)
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Toast notification appears instantly
