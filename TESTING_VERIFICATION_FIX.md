# Verification Flash Fix - Testing Guide

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. **Test Fresh Login (Most Important)**
```bash
# Clear browser data
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear Storage > Clear site data
4. Refresh page
5. Login with non-verified account
6. Watch navbar and dropdown - should NOT see items appearing/disappearing
```

### 2. **Test Dropdown Behavior**
```bash
# With non-verified account
1. Click profile dropdown
2. Observe: All restricted items should be greyed out immediately
3. Close dropdown
4. Open again
5. Observe: No "transformation" effect - same state as before
```

### 3. **Test Page Navigation**
```bash
# Navigate between pages
1. Go to /profile
2. Go back to /
3. Go to /discover  
4. Watch navbar each time - restrictions should be instant, not gradual
```

### 4. **Test Verification Upload**
```bash
# Upload verification documents
1. Go to Profile > Verification
2. Upload required documents
3. Check navbar - should immediately show unrestricted items
4. No gradual "unlocking" effect
```

## Expected Results

### ❌ **Before Fix (Bad)**:
- Links appear → then fade to disabled one by one
- Dropdown shows enabled items → then disables them progressively  
- Jerky, unprofessional appearance

### ✅ **After Fix (Good)**:
- Restricted items appear disabled immediately
- No visible transformations
- Smooth, professional appearance
- Consistent behavior across all interactions

## Browser Testing
Test in multiple browsers:
- Chrome (normal + incognito)
- Firefox
- Safari (if available)
- Edge

## Performance Check
- Open DevTools > Performance
- Record navigation interactions
- Check for unnecessary re-renders
- Should see cleaner, more efficient rendering

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Still seeing flash**: Clear browser cache completely
2. **Items not restricted**: Check verification documents are properly cleared
3. **Dropdown issues**: Test with various screen sizes
4. **Mobile behavior**: Test on mobile devices

## Debug Mode
If issues persist, add this to console:
```javascript
// Check verification status
window.addEventListener('verificationStatusChanged', () => {
  console.log('Verification status changed');
});
```

The fix should eliminate ALL visible transformations and provide instant, consistent UI behavior.
